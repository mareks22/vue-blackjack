# BlackJack made with Vue 3.

## To run it: 

1) Clone repo
2) Open folder with an IDE
3) run `npm install`
4) run `npm run start`
5) Open http://localhost:8080/

## Future plans :
Missing features that I plan to implement : 
- Splitting on same card (blackjack rules)
- Making the web application responsive on all devices
